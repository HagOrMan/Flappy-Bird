# Flappy-Bird
A game of Flappy Bird created using python

Uses pygame because I kind of needed that to have my timers, text, and everything else. 

Also imports random because I wanted the obstacles to be randomly generated, saving me the energy of planning out the entire game in advance.

Apologies for all the images, I kind of needed tons of them in order to let the user choose multiple colours.
And the bird is tilted up/down when jumping/falling so that multiplied my quantity of images by three.
